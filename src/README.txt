We have 4 files that make up my checkers module.

ApplyMove: Applies a move to a GameState and returns the new GameState.

ABSearch: Uses a-b pruning to find the best possible move for the AI to make, also contains our two AI functions.

Heuristic: The heuristic we use to determine how "good" a certain GameState is for a player.
